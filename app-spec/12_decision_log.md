## Closed Decisions

### DEC-029: Bounded Reply Pattern — Mandatory for All New LLM-Authored Fields

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Date** | 2026-07-14 |
| **Status** | ✅ Closed |
| **Summary** | Any new LLM-authored text field (verdict explanations, buy-intent `reply`, integrity summaries) follows the Bounded Reply Pattern (DEC-022): a single fenced JSON field, an explicit one-line purpose in the prompt, tone/length bounds, 2-3 concrete in-prompt few-shot examples, and a deterministic Dart fallback. Any new intent-detection call must be history-free. |
| **Rationale** | DEC-022 established the pattern for all existing LLM fields. The buy-intent detector and verdict engine introduce new LLM-authored fields — these must follow the same BRP guardrails. |
| **Impact** | gemini_service.dart gains one new isolated system prompt (`_buyIntentSystemPrompt`) following the exact structure of `_setupIntentSystemPrompt`. All number-bearing fields are Dart-computed; the LLM authors only the `reply` text. |
| **Related** | DEC-022 (BRP), DEC-003 (LLM never calculates) |

### DEC-026: "Can I Buy?" MVP Formula — No Proration, DTI 33% Cap, Unknown-Income Refusal

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Date** | 2026-07-14 |
| **Status** | ✅ Closed |
| **Summary** | The "Can I Buy?" verdict engine uses MVP formula: Verdict = f(disposable_after_commitments, current-month expense total, active-goal impact). Days-to-salary proration dropped. DTI > 33% forces NO. Unknown/zero income triggers need-info. All aggregations filter `type='expense' AND is_deleted=false`. |
| **Rationale** | Original PRD required `days_remaining_to_salary` — no capture mechanism. DTI 33% is hard safety rule from ACID constraints. |
| **Impact** | `PurchaseDecisionService` (pure Dart per DEC-024). Backlog BUY-02 (Edge Function) cancelled. |
| **Related** | DEC-024, `17_data_architecture_acid_constraints.md §2` |

### DEC-025: Integrity Score — 3 Real Factors Only, 2 Locked (Post Bank-Linking)

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Date** | 2026-07-14 |
| **Status** | ✅ Closed |
| **Summary** | Integrity Score MVP computes ONLY 3 real factors: `logging_consistency`, `receipt_upload_rate`, `no_deletion_rate` — re-weighted to sum 100%. The 2 factors needing bank-linking (`data_match_accuracy`, `response_time_factor`) are displayed as locked ("قادم مع الربط البنكي") and NEVER assigned a numeric value. DB columns for all 5 remain — the 2 locked stay NULL. |
| **Rationale** | Assigning fabricated values creates trust-fabrication risk in a product whose core value proposition IS trustworthiness. |
| **Impact** | `IntegrityScoreService` (pure Dart) computes from 3 factors. The fabricated "92% match" example in `03_user_flows_navigation.md` is replaced. |
| **Related** | DEC-024, `05_data_model_erd.md §4`, `03_user_flows_navigation.md` |

### DEC-024: All Financial Math in Dart — No Edge Functions, No LLM Arithmetic

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Date** | 2026-07-14 |
| **Status** | ✅ Closed |
| **Summary** | All financial calculations (disposable income, DTI, verdict, integrity factors) are implemented in pure Dart. No Supabase Edge Functions compute any financial math. No LLM performs arithmetic — the LLM's role is strictly bounded to natural-language tasks (intent detection, generating `reply` text per DEC-029/BRP). |
| **Rationale** | DEC-003 established "LLM understands and routes — SQL calculates." Original backlog assigned BUY-02 to an Edge Function, violating this constraint. Dart-side is testable, debuggable, keeps financial logic in-repo. |
| **Impact** | `PurchaseDecisionService` + `IntegrityScoreService` are pure Dart. BUY-02 Edge Function cancelled. |
| **Related** | DEC-003, DEC-025, DEC-026, `07_flutter_architecture.md §10` |

### DEC-020: Cancel-Before-Confirm + Transaction Undo (Hackathon MVP Scope)

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Date** | 2026-07-12 |
| **Status** | ✅ Closed |
| **Summary** | Two additions to close a real gap found during live OCR testing: (1) `compound_split_card` gets a "❌ إلغاء" discard action alongside "✅ تأكيد الكل" — lets the user drop a wrong/bad receipt upload before anything is written to Supabase. (2) A short-lived "تراجع" (undo) quick-action attached to the "تم تسجيل بنجاح ✅" confirmation message, soft-deleting that specific transaction (`is_deleted = true`) if tapped. Both target the moment a mistaken image upload can turn into a duplicated transaction. |
| **Rationale** | Live device testing surfaced a real scenario: user uploads a wrong/miscropped image, has no way to discard it before confirming, and if they confirm-then-reupload-correct, both get saved as separate transactions — a genuine duplicate-data risk, not just a UI annoyance. Fix (1) prevents bad data from ever reaching the database — cheapest, highest-leverage fix, since it stops the problem at its source. Fix (2) covers the case where the mistake is only noticed after confirming; it costs almost nothing to add since `transactions.is_deleted`/`deleted_at` already exist and are already used everywhere else in the schema (anti-ghost, no-hard-delete principle) — this is wiring up a UI trigger for a capability the data model already has, not new infrastructure. |
| **Alternatives** | (A) Full transaction list/edit/delete management view — rejected for now: real feature, bigger scope than this bug warrants, not what actually broke during testing. Revisit in Stage 4/5 if full transaction management becomes a real product need, not as a fix for this. (B) Do nothing, rely on users being careful — rejected: this is a hackathon MVP demoed live in front of judges; a stuck bad transaction with no recovery path is a real risk during a live demo, not a hypothetical edge case. |
| **Impact** | `lib/features/chat/widgets/widget_catalog.dart` (compound_split_card cancel action), `lib/features/chat/chat_screen.dart` (undo quick-action wiring + soft-delete call), `lib/features/chat/services/transaction_service.dart` (needs a `deleteTransaction(id)` / soft-delete method — doesn't exist yet). No schema change — `is_deleted`/`deleted_at` already deployed. Scoped to the OCR/image flow where the bug was found; the undo mechanism itself is generic enough to reuse for any confirmed transaction later, not OCR-specific. |
| **Related** | `16_implementation_backlog.md §Stage 3` (OCR-05 added), `app-spec/INIT-03_supabase_schema.md` (existing soft-delete columns), `lib/features/chat/widgets/widget_catalog.dart` |

### DEC-021: Auto-Save Simple Transactions, Drop Confirm Tap

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Date** | 2026-07-13 |
| **Status** | ✅ Closed |
| **Summary** | Single-item transactions save immediately on classification; the ✅ صحيح / 🔄 تعديل confirm step is removed for this case. `↩️ تراجع` (undo, DEC-020) is the safety net. |
| **Rationale** | The app's own empty-state tagline promises "بدون تعب" (effortless) — a mandatory confirm-tap on every logged expense contradicts that. The old "🔄 تعديل" never did real inline editing anyway (just replied with a plain-text re-prompt), so undo-then-retype is strictly cleaner than edit-then-retype. Zero-tap auto-logging reads as stronger AI confidence in a live demo. |
| **Alternatives** | (A) Keep confirm-before-save — rejected, contradicts product positioning and adds a tap with no real correction benefit over undo. (B) Auto-save with no undo — rejected, removes the only safety net for misclassification. |
| **Impact** | `compound_split_card` (multi-item messages) is unaffected — it keeps its real ❌ إلغاء / ✅ تأكيد step, since the user can genuinely adjust amounts there before anything saves. Deleted `_confirmTransaction`, `_isConfirming`, `_tryAutoClassify`, and the confirm/edit `action_buttons` handler cases. |
| **Related** | DEC-020 (undo/cancel), `03_user_flows_navigation.md` Flow: Transaction Entry |

### DEC-022: Bounded Reply Pattern (BRP) — Mandatory for All LLM-Authored Text Fields

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Date** | 2026-07-13 |
| **Status** | ✅ Closed |
| **Summary** | Any bot-facing text authored by an LLM (not hardcoded Dart strings) must be: (1) a single named JSON field, never a whole free-form message; (2) given an explicit one-line purpose in its prompt; (3) bounded by an explicit tone/length/don't-list; (4) backed by 2-3 concrete few-shot examples written directly into the prompt (never conversation history); (5) given a deterministic Dart fallback for empty/malformed output. |
| **Rationale** | The prior session's 7 prompt iterations (history-leak fix saga) drifted because there was no standing rule to check new prompt text against — instructions were added and removed ad hoc under time pressure, causing new regressions each time (bare-number parsing broke, responses became incoherent). BRP gives future prompt edits a checklist so this doesn't recur. |
| **Alternatives** | (A) Fully free-form LLM text everywhere — rejected, risks inconsistency/drift and cannot guarantee JSON safety. (B) Fully hardcoded strings everywhere — rejected, loses the actual value of personalization at the moments that matter most (Cold Start first impression, per-transaction reaction, OCR receipt summary). |
| **Impact** | Applies to: router `reply` (3 kinds), coach prompt replies, `reactToColdStart`, `ocrReceipt`'s new `reply` field. Does NOT apply to structural/systemic strings (loading states, error boundaries, button labels, undo/cancel acks) — those stay hardcoded permanently by design, not as an oversight. |
| **Related** | DEC-003 (LLM never calculates), DEC-020 (undo), DEC-021 (auto-save) |

### DEC-023: `financial_profile` Table — Durable Home for Cold Start Estimates

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Date** | 2026-07-13 |
| **Status** | ✅ Closed |
| **Summary** | New table stores income, commitments estimate, weekly-spend estimate, and an unused-for-now salary_day, one row per user. Cold Start now persists all 3 submitted answers here instead of discarding 2 of them. |
| **Rationale** | Income was only a loosely-tagged transaction row; commitments/weekly-spend estimates were computed for the insight message and thrown away, breaking DEC-019's promise that commitments would reuse them. Without this, COMMIT-01/BUY-01 silently block. |
| **Alternatives** | (A) On-device key-value store — rejected, loses Supabase single-source-of-truth. |

### DEC-033: Commitment/Goal Setup Intent — Pre-Router Heuristic

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Date** | 2026-07-13 |
| **Status** | ✅ Closed |
| **Summary** | Cheap local keyword heuristic runs before the existing digit-gate router; on match, isolated history-free `classifySetupIntent` decides `commitment_add|view|edit`, `goal_add|view|edit`, or `none`. On `none`/failure, falls through to unmodified existing router. |
| **Rationale** | Closes entry-point gap for commitments/goals without touching `_classifySystemPrompt` (stabilized over 3 MoA rounds). Digit-bearing commitment phrases are intercepted by digit gate first — a real blind spot. |
| **Impact** | New prompt + method + handlers; zero changes to existing router/coach prompts. |

### DEC-036: Stage 4 BUY+INTG — 5 Critical Fixes Required After "No Deviations" Claim (DEC-035)

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Date** | 2026-07-14 |
| **Status** | ✅ Closed |
| **Summary** | DEC-035 logged Stage 4 as "implemented without deviations" based on `flutter analyze`/`flutter test` passing (34/34) and the swarm's own Zero-Trust Auditor + SCSI Guardian both reporting APPROVE with 0 CRITICAL findings. Independent live-device testing plus direct Supabase queries found 5 critical bugs those gates missed entirely, all now fixed and re-verified: (1) `_confirmPurchase` inserted into `purchase_decisions` using columns (`item`, `amount`) that don't exist on the live table — every purchase confirmation failed 100% of the time (commit `9497c82`); (2) `_QuickInputFormWidgetState`'s submit button never disabled after use — unlimited duplicate commitment/goal rows possible (commit `428006f`); (3) 8 success-message call sites passed the same sentence as both the bubble text and the widget's `question` field, rendering it twice (commit `428006f`); (4) every form-submitted numeric field (`double.tryParse`) lacked Arabic-Indic digit normalization — a value typed on an Arabic keyboard silently failed to parse and nothing saved, with no error shown in several cases (commit `a885438`); (5) fixing #2 replaced a manual field whitelist with a `...json` spread, which silently dropped an implicit key rename (`_form_kind` → `form_kind`) the old code depended on — every commitment/goal/income-clarification submission fell through to a generic acknowledgement with **no save at all**, for the several hours between commits `428006f` and `3b1a006`. |
| **Rationale** | None of these 5 bugs were caught by `flutter analyze`, `flutter test`, or the swarm's own audit/guardian sign-off — all 5 were found only through live-device interaction plus direct Supabase queries comparing what the code assumed against the actual deployed schema/state. Bug #5 is the most instructive: it was a regression introduced *by* the fix for bug #2, in the same commit, and would have shipped invisibly if the human hadn't tested the actual save behavior (not just "does the button visually disable") after the fix landed. |
| **Alternatives** | None — this is a record of what was found and fixed, not a design choice. |
| **Impact** | Confirms LL-010 (below): "34/34 tests passing" and an agent's own self-reported audit approval are necessary but never sufficient signals for this project. Every Stage-4 fix from this point forward was verified via a live device test plus a direct Supabase query showing the actual row created/updated — that discipline caught all 5 of the above and should continue for any future stage. |

### DEC-037: Stage 4 Round 2 — 4 More Bugs Found on Retest, Plus an Opus 4.8 Architecture Consult

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Date** | 2026-07-15 |
| **Status** | ✅ Closed |
| **Summary** | A second live-device test pass (after DEC-036's 5 fixes shipped) found 4 more real bugs, all fixed and re-verified: (1) `financial_profile.upsert()` never reset `is_deleted`/`deleted_at` — a singleton row soft-deleted once (during earlier test-data cleanup) stayed permanently invisible to every future read, so "Can I Buy?" asked for income forever with no way out regardless of how many times it was resubmitted (commit `c7f16a6`); (2) `_showCommitmentList` rendered every commitment with one unconditional `"$remaining / $total ريال (شهرياً $monthly)"` format — for recurring/open-ended commitments (rent, subscriptions) where the add-form never collects a fixed total, `total` defaults to `monthly`, so the row showed the same number three times (commit `c7f16a6`); (3) OCR-photographed receipts uploaded to Storage successfully but the resulting URL was only `print()`-ed to logcat, never attached to the transaction rows `saveCompoundSplits` wrote — `receipt_upload_rate` was mathematically stuck at 0% forever since every receipt goes through the compound-split path (commit `c7f16a6`); (4) `ElevatedButton.styleFrom()` set `backgroundColor`/`foregroundColor` but never the `disabled*` variants, so once a widget's buttons hit `onPressed: null` (the "answered" state every action_buttons/quick_input_form/compound_split_card widget relies on), Flutter's own default disabled palette silently replaced the custom colors — this, not the opacity constant, was why answered buttons lost their fill/border/legible text (commits `c7f16a6`, `c9fecf9`). |
| **Rationale** | Same pattern as DEC-036: none of these were static-analysis or unit-test catchable — found only by driving the real device and, for #1 and #3, cross-checking the live Supabase rows directly. #4 is the most instructive of this round: an opacity bump (0.55→0.85) applied first as a plausible-looking fix was itself treating the wrong layer — direct pixel-sampling of a live screenshot (measuring actual RGB values at text-stroke locations) was needed to discover the real mechanism was Material's disabled-state color override, not insufficient contrast from the opacity wrapper. |
| **Alternatives** | None — record of what was found and fixed. |
| **Impact** | A follow-up retest (same session) surfaced a 5th, separate class of bug: the local Arabic-keyword regex gates (`_buyKeywords` etc.) required exact hamza spelling, silently missing common dialectal typing that drops it (e.g. "ابي اشتري" vs the pattern's "أبي أشتري") — the LLM classifier was simply never invoked. Because "Can I Buy?" is the product's signature/brand feature, this was escalated to a dedicated Opus 4.8 consultation (see DEC-037-B below) rather than patched reactively again. |

### DEC-037-B: Can-I-Buy Intent Detection — Safety Net Now, Unified Router Deferred (Opus 4.8 Consult)

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Date** | 2026-07-15 |
| **Status** | ✅ Closed (safety net shipped; router migration explicitly deferred) |
| **Summary** | Consulted Opus 4.8 on whether the hand-curated local-regex pre-filter in front of `classifyBuyIntent`/`classifySetupIntent`/`classifyIntegrityQuery` is the right shape for the product's most brand-critical feature, given a regex miss was silently degrading to a fluent-but-wrong generic chat reply rather than a visible failure. Opus's finding: a regex pre-filter is a reasonable *cost* optimization but must never be an authoritative *correctness* gate — a miss must never be indistinguishable from "the feature doesn't apply here." Recommendation adopted: (a) **now** — add a `classifyBuyIntent` safety-net check inside `classifyTransaction`'s own `'chat'` fallback branch for any digit-bearing message, reusing the existing history-free classifier with zero new prompts (commit `1305ce3`); (b) **deferred to post-hackathon** — retire the three regex gates as correctness gates in favor of one unified history-free router call classifying every message into `{transaction, buy_intent, setup_intent, integrity_query, chat}`, which is latency-neutral-to-better than today's up-to-4-sequential-calls worst case and fully preserves the history-free isolation invariant from the earlier rebundling saga. |
| **Rationale** | The digit path already gives a free interception point (`classifyTransaction` already deliberately returns `'chat'` for buy-intent phrasing it recognizes but declines to handle) — inserting the safety net there has near-zero blast radius and catches any unlisted phrasing, not just the specific hamza gap found. The full router rewrite touches the single most bug-prone function in the app (`_sendMessage` — site of the earlier multi-iteration history-leak saga) and was judged too risky to land ~36 hours before the AMAD demo without a full re-test of the intent matrix. |
| **Alternatives considered** | "Classify on every regex miss" was considered and rejected as effectively identical in cost to the unified router (most messages miss the regex anyway) while adding more moving parts, not fewer. |
| **Impact** | Also fixed in the same pass: `_buyIntentSystemPrompt` had grouped "هل أقدر أشتري X بـ Y" (a concrete item+amount, just phrased as a question) under `buy_query` instead of `buy_intent` — rewritten so any message naming an item is always `buy_intent` regardless of interrogative phrasing; and a self-inflicted regression where `_normalizeArabic()` was applied to user input but not to the keyword regex patterns themselves, so a pattern containing ى/ة (e.g. "ابغى") could never match already-normalized input (commit `1305ce3`). |

### DEC-038: Remaining-Budget Query — New Deterministic Feature, No LLM

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Date** | 2026-07-15 |
| **Status** | ✅ Closed |
| **Summary** | Added a "كم باقي من ميزانيتي؟" (how much budget is left) query, mirroring the existing integrity-score-query pattern: a local keyword pre-filter routes matching messages straight to a new `PurchaseDecisionService.calculateRemainingBudget()` — the same deterministic factors as `evaluate()` (income, active commitments, current-month expense total, active goal contributions) minus a specific purchase amount — with zero LLM calls. If no income is on file, asks for it via the existing `quick_input_form` pattern and re-runs the calculation immediately after submission. |
| **Rationale** | This question previously fell through to the free-form coach chat, which has no real computation behind it (violates DEC-003: LLM must never calculate financially) and was observed live going stale/off-topic — it answered a budget question with leftover conversational context about an unrelated earlier topic (gasoline) instead of a real number. |
| **Alternatives** | None — this is the same "deterministic Dart + cheap keyword gate, no LLM" shape already proven by the integrity-score query; no reason to design it differently. |
| **Impact** | `lib/features/chat/services/purchase_decision_service.dart` (`calculateRemainingBudget`), `lib/features/chat/chat_screen.dart` (`_looksLikeBudgetQuery`, `_showRemainingBudget`, `budget_query_clarification` form-kind). |

### DEC-047: "ابدأ من جديد كزائر" — Reset-to-New-Guest for Shared-Device Demo Testing

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Date** | 2026-07-15 |
| **Status** | ✅ Closed |
| **Summary** | Founder asked directly: since DEC-017's anonymous session persists on-device, will every judge who hands-on tests the same demo phone at AMAD continue on whatever guest data the previous person (or the founder's own testing) left behind, instead of a genuine first-run experience? Confirmed: yes — that's DEC-017 working exactly as designed for a real production device (one phone = one guest), but it's a real problem when AMAD judges will physically pick up and test the same phone one after another. Added a "الحساب" row in `account_screen.dart`, visible for both guest and real accounts, that shows a confirmation dialog then calls `signOut()` → `signInAnonymously()` (fresh UUID) → sets `azdalFirstLaunch = true` → `context.go('/')`, replaying the full splash → onboarding → Cold Start flow from zero. Old data is never deleted — it stays in Supabase under the old `user_id`, orphaned but harmless (same accepted trade-off DEC-017 already documented), and is recoverable by logging back into that same account. |
| **Rationale** | Device-verified with full instrumentation, not just code review — an early manual test looked broken (landed back on the Account tab instead of onboarding), which turned out to be **my own adb tap landing on the wrong element** (a coordinate-scaling mistake, confirmed via `uiautomator dump` bounds), not a code bug. Re-verified with temporary debug prints tracing every step (`confirmed=true` → `signed out` → `signed in anon` → `azdalFirstLaunch=true` → `go(/) called` → splash's own `_next` reading `azdalFirstLaunch=true`) plus screenshots, confirming the full splash → onboarding → empty Cold Start sequence renders correctly end-to-end. Diagnostics removed before commit. |
| **Alternatives** | Manually clearing app storage via Android Settings between judges — rejected as the fallback-only option: slower and more error-prone mid-demo than a single in-app tap, though still works if needed. Auto-resetting on every app launch — rejected: would break guest data persistence for any real single continuous user, defeating the entire point of DEC-017. |
| **Impact** | `lib/features/account/account_screen.dart` only — one new row + one new method (`_startAsNewGuest`). No changes to auth architecture, RLS, or any other screen. |
| **Related** | DEC-017 (the persisted-guest-session design this operationalizes a reset for) |

### DEC-046: Cold-Start Commitments Estimate Silently Ignored — Purchases Over-Approved

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Date** | 2026-07-15 |
| **Status** | ✅ Closed |
| **Summary** | Founder registered a fresh real account end-to-end (Cold Start → chat) and the coach approved a purchase clearly beyond the user's ability — asking "لابتوب بـ 4000 ريال؟" got "تقدر! باقي لك 1740 ريال" as a `yes`. Traced with a real Supabase account (`74e40a09-…`), not a guess: Cold Start correctly wrote `monthly_commitments_estimate = 3500` to `financial_profile` and even echoed it back ("باقي معك 3500 ريال بعد الالتزامات"). But `PurchaseDecisionService.evaluate()` and `.calculateRemainingBudget()` never read that field again — every later "can I afford X" / "كم باقي مصروف" calculation summed **only** the itemized `commitments` table. The user had itemized just one commitment so far (rent, 1000/month — DEC-033's own onboarding message explicitly invites itemizing "one at a time"), so 2500 SAR/month of self-declared, real committed spending was invisible to every affordability check. Reconstructing the exact math (income 7000, itemized commitments 1000, month-spend 60 at eval time, goal 200, laptop 4000) reproduced the buggy `disposable=1740 → yes` byte-for-byte, confirming this — not a formula sign error — was the root cause. Fixed by taking `max(profileEstimate, itemizedSum)` for commitments in both methods, so the un-itemized remainder of the Cold Start estimate keeps counting until (or unless) real itemized commitments exceed it. |
| **Rationale** | Verified twice, independently: (1) hand-traced the exact pre-fix formula against the real DB rows and got the exact buggy output (1740, yes) that shipped to the user, proving the true root cause rather than a plausible-sounding guess; (2) after the code fix, ran a **fresh, independent SQL query** (not a reuse of the same by-hand arithmetic) against the same live rows, confirming commitments now resolve to 3500, DTI to 50% — over the existing 33% DEC-026 cap — so the fixed code returns `no`, not `yes`. Couldn't drive the exact chat message myself to see it end-to-end in the UI: `adb shell input text` cannot type Arabic (a known, pre-existing tooling limitation), so live confirmation of the *specific reworded chat reply* is left for the founder to re-check (the account and updated build are already in place on-device). |
| **Alternatives** | Treat the Cold Start estimate as fully superseded once the user itemizes anything — rejected: itemizing one commitment doesn't mean the rest stopped existing; would have re-introduced this exact bug for every user who itemizes gradually. Re-prompting the user to explicitly confirm "did you finish itemizing everything?" would be the more complete fix but is a bigger UX change deferred post-hackathon (noted below). |
| **Impact** | `lib/features/chat/services/purchase_decision_service.dart` only — `evaluate()` and `calculateRemainingBudget()` both now fetch `monthly_commitments_estimate` and take the max against the itemized sum. **Deferred, not fixed tonight:** there's no mechanism to ever retire the Cold Start estimate once a user has itemized everything for real (it will keep acting as a floor forever) — a real gap, but safer to over-count commitments than under-count them, so left as a post-hackathon follow-up rather than risk a same-night UX change to the itemization flow. |
| **Related** | DEC-026 (33% DTI cap this now correctly enforces), DEC-033 (the itemization-over-time onboarding flow that created the gap), DEC-038/DEC-039 (the remaining-budget and completion-detection features sharing this same service) |

### DEC-045: Splash Screen Off-Center Logo — Loose-Width Column, Unrelated to RTL

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Date** | 2026-07-15 |
| **Status** | ✅ Closed |
| **Summary** | Founder reported the splash screen's logo/title/tagline rendering shifted hard left instead of centered. Root-caused via device instrumentation (RenderBox constraint dump), not guesswork: `splash_screen.dart`'s `Column` sits directly under `Scaffold > SafeArea` with no scrollview/`Expanded`-with-filler child, so it received a **loose** width constraint (`0<=w<=392.7` logical px) from its ancestors and shrank to its widest child (the "أزدل" title, ~178px) instead of the full screen — then that narrow box sat flush at the left edge since nothing centered the box itself (`CrossAxisAlignment.center` only centers children *within* the Column's own resolved width, which was wrong). This is a **plain, pre-existing Flutter layout bug, unrelated to DEC-044's RTL fix** — confirmed by checking every other new screen (onboarding/courses/account/bank/journey/auth): all of them wrap their content in `ListView`/`PageView`, which force a tight full-width cross-axis constraint by construction, so none of them share this bug. Fixed by wrapping the splash Column in `SizedBox(width: double.infinity, ...)` to force a tight full-width constraint before centering. Device-verified via burst screenshots (8 frames, 150ms apart) before and after: before, content was reproducibly stuck at the same off-center position across every frame (ruling out the transition-artifact explanation from an earlier session); after, logo/title/full tagline (previously clipped off the left edge) all render centered, pixel-stable across frames. |
| **Rationale** | Diagnosed with hard data rather than trial-and-error: added a temporary `RenderBox.constraints`/`.size` poll (removed before commit) that printed `BoxConstraints(0.0<=w<=392.7, ...)` and `colSize=Size(178.3, ...)` to logcat — a loose constraint is the unambiguous signature of this exact Flutter footgun (a bare `Column` with no `CrossAxisAlignment.stretch`, no filling child, and no explicit width shrink-wraps instead of filling). Ruling out RTL as a cause matters because the founder explicitly worried the RTL fix might be damaging screens he liked — it wasn't; this bug predates DEC-044 and was simply never caught because splash is only visible for 1.4s, previously screenshotted once and misdiagnosed as a page-transition artifact. |
| **Alternatives** | `CrossAxisAlignment.stretch` on the Column — rejected: would force every child (including the fixed-size `BrandMark` image) to accept a tight full-width constraint it doesn't need, a larger behavioral change than necessary for a centering fix. |
| **Impact** | `lib/features/launch/splash_screen.dart` only — one `SizedBox(width: double.infinity)` wrapper. No other files touched. `flutter analyze` clean, `flutter test` 34/34 passing, device-verified. |
| **Related** | DEC-044 (the RTL fix this was initially suspected to have caused, but didn't) |

### DEC-044: Investor-Facing Shell + Real RTL Fix — App Was Rendering LTR Since Day One

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Date** | 2026-07-15 |
| **Status** | ✅ Closed |
| **Summary** | Added the investor-facing polish layer (Fable-designed, full consult in session transcript): splash → onboarding (first launch only) → 3-tab shell (المحادثة/الدورات/حسابي) via `IndexedStack` (ChatScreen mounted once, untouched); حسابي hosts a mock 3-step bank-linking flow, a "خطتك نحو الاستثمار" 3-tier vision/journey screen (mock net-worth chart + unlock checklist), and REAL email/password signup+login wired to the existing DEC-017 anonymous-upgrade path (`updateUser`/`signInWithPassword` — same UUID, zero data migration, device-verified end-to-end including a live Supabase check). Corrected a stale doc reference in passing: `azdal-logo.png` was never on disk; the real asset (moved to `assets/branding/Azdal logo.jpeg` during this session) already matched the DEC-013 mark. **Separately, the founder caught a real RTL bug by using the device himself**: every new screen had icons/nav order/chevrons mirrored wrong. Root cause — `MaterialApp.router`'s own `Localizations` widget always re-inserts a fresh `Directionality` below itself, derived from the active `WidgetsLocalizations`; with no `localizationsDelegates` configured that's `DefaultWidgetsLocalizations` → hardcoded LTR, silently overriding the manual `Directionality(rtl)` wrapper in `main.dart` that sat above `MaterialApp`. **The entire app has been rendering LTR since day one** — chat only ever looked correct because it hardcodes explicit RTL on its own key widgets (input bar, TextField, bubble text) instead of trusting ambient direction. Fixed by replacing the dead wrapper with real localization (`locale: ar` + `Global{Material,Widgets,Cupertino}Localizations` delegates) and pinning `chat_screen.dart`'s `build()` in an explicit `Directionality(ltr)` wrapper so the newly-corrected app-wide RTL cannot move a pixel of the already-stabilized chat screen. |
| **Rationale** | Investor-facing screens: judges respond to seeing the 3-tier vision (Coach → Lender → Wealth Builder) made tangible, not just the Tier-1 MVP; kept as pure mock/static content (bank-linking, journey) plus one genuinely real feature (auth) since DEC-017 already anticipated the exact upgrade path with near-zero extra risk. RTL: verified via SDK source (Flutter 3.41.6) that Material 3's `tall2021`/`englishLike2021` type scales are token-identical, so the locale change carries zero typography risk; the chat pin was verified to reproduce today's exact rendering bit-for-bit (device-compared before/after). |
| **Alternatives** | RTL: a `MaterialApp.router(builder: ...)`-level `Directionality` override also works and avoids the new `flutter_localizations` dependency, but leaves tooltips/text-selection menus in English and keeps the "hack around the framework" pattern that caused this bug in the first place — rejected once the typography risk of the proper fix was confirmed zero. |
| **Impact** | New files: `lib/app/{brand,launch_flags}.dart`, `lib/features/{launch/{splash_screen,onboarding_screen},shell/main_shell,courses/courses_screen,account/account_screen,bank/bank_link_flow_screen,journey/journey_screen,auth/{auth_service,auth_ui,login_screen,signup_screen}}.dart`. Modified: `lib/app/{app_router,providers}.dart`, `lib/main.dart` (locale/delegates), `lib/features/chat/chat_screen.dart` (RTL pin), `pubspec.yaml` (`flutter_localizations`). Known deferred (not done tonight, explicitly out of scope): phone/SMS login, password reset, logout, `linkIdentity` OAuth, real bank backend, real course content, chat's own internals still use the legacy LTR-pinned pattern rather than proper RTL (a dedicated follow-up pass, not urgent — chat is correct as pinned). |
| **Related** | DEC-006 (superseded — chat is no longer the sole screen), DEC-013, DEC-017, DEC-036 through DEC-039 (verification discipline this was built under) |

### DEC-039: Advanced Retest Round — History-Leak Into Coach Chat, Completion-Detection Gap, and 3 Explicitly Deferred Product Gaps

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Date** | 2026-07-15 |
| **Status** | ✅ Closed (2 bugs fixed); 3 items explicitly deferred, not bugs |
| **Summary** | A round of medium/advanced scenario testing (interactions and edge cases, not basics) found 2 more real bugs, both fixed: (1) `filteredHistory` excluded a triggering user message from the general coach's conversation history whenever an isolated intent flow (buy-intent/setup-intent/integrity/budget) handled it, but never excluded the bot's own widget-bearing reply to that message — the coach's later calls saw a dangling, question-less verdict/form/card and would drag its content into unrelated follow-up questions (observed live: an unrelated question got an answer contaminated by an earlier buy-intent verdict about a bicycle). Fixed by excluding any bot message that carries a widget from coach history — only plain-text replies stay in context (commit `2c71df7`). (2) `_submitCommitmentAdjust`/`_submitGoalAdjust` always called `updateRemaining`/`updateCurrentAmount` unconditionally, even when the new value meant the item was actually finished (remaining ≤ 0, or current ≥ target) — the row stayed `status='active'` with a generic "updated" reply instead of recognizing completion, until the user separately used the dedicated "mark complete" action. Both now detect the completing condition and call `markCompleted`/`markAchieved` with the congratulatory reply instead (commit `2c71df7`). |
| **Rationale** | Same discipline as DEC-036/037: found by driving real interaction sequences on-device, not by static analysis. |
| **Alternatives** | None for the 2 fixed bugs — straightforward corrections. |
| **Deferred, not bugs — explicit product decisions for post-hackathon:** | **(a)** Sending two distinct purchase requests in one message ("أبي أشتري جوال بـ 2000 ودراجة بـ 800") confuses `classifyBuyIntent`'s single-item extraction; sending them as two separate messages works correctly. Narrow edge case, not fixed now — the classifier is documented as single-item-per-message by design. **(b)** There is no direct way to ask "كم نسبة التزاماتي؟" (what's my DTI ratio) — it's only ever surfaced as a side effect of a buy-intent verdict. Same shape as the gap DEC-038 just closed for remaining budget; a natural, low-risk follow-up but not done tonight. **(c)** Marking a commitment "خلصته بالكامل" only flips its status — it does not create a corresponding expense transaction recording that real money left the user's account to pay it off, so that month's spending/remaining-budget/integrity-score figures don't reflect it. This is a genuine, valid data-completeness gap the founder raised directly; it's a materially bigger change (needs a confirm/amount UX, interacts with the undo/soft-delete path, and touches the money-movement invariant this whole app is built to track correctly) and was judged too risky to land ~24 hours before the AMAD demo. Recorded here so it isn't lost, not because it's low-priority for a production version. |
| **Impact** | `app-spec/00_active_capabilities.md` §Stage 4, §⬜ NOT STARTED (deferred items added there too). |

### DEC-035: Stage 4 BUY+INTG — Implemented Without Deviations

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Date** | 2026-07-14 |
| **Status** | ✅ Closed |
| **Summary** | Stage 4 BUY+INTG implemented exactly per DEC-024/025/026/029 without deviations. `PurchaseDecisionService` (pure Dart, DTI 33% cap, no-proration MVP), `IntegrityScoreService` (3 active factors, 2 locked), buy-intent detector (BRP-compliant, history-free), and verdict widget all shipped. BUY-02 Edge Function cancelled per DEC-024/026. |
| **Rationale** | DEC-024 mandated pure Dart for all financial math — both services are pure Dart. DEC-025 mandated 3 real factors only with 2 locked — `IntegrityScoreService` computes exactly 3 factors, displays 2 as locked badges. DEC-026 set DTI 33% cap + no-proration + unknown-income refusal — `PurchaseDecisionService` implements all three. DEC-029 mandated BRP for new LLM fields — `_buyIntentSystemPrompt` follows the exact structure of `_setupIntentSystemPrompt`. |
| **Alternatives** | None — implementation followed the design decisions exactly. |
| **Impact** | `lib/core/services/purchase_decision_service.dart`, `lib/core/services/integrity_score_service.dart`, `lib/features/chat/widgets/widget_catalog.dart` (verdict widget + integrity summary), `lib/core/services/gemini_service.dart` (`_buyIntentSystemPrompt`). BUY-02 cancelled. |

### DEC-034: `quick_input_form` — Optional `prefill` + `_form_kind`

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Date** | 2026-07-13 |
| **Status** | ✅ Closed |
| **Summary** | Fields gain optional `prefill` (TextEditingController). Widget JSON gains optional `_form_kind` echoed as `form_kind` in submit payload. Both default to today's behavior when absent. |
| **Rationale** | Needed for LLM-draft pre-filling and clean form routing. Replaces fragile key-sniffing that doesn't scale past one form. |

### DEC-019: "Can I Buy?" (BUY-01→04) Moved From Stage 3 to Stage 4

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Date** | 2026-07-12 |
| **Status** | ✅ Closed |
| **Summary** | BUY-01→04 removed from Stage 3 and rescheduled into Stage 4, sequenced after the new COMMIT-01 and existing GOAL-01. Stage 3 is now OCR-only (OCR-01→04). |
| **Rationale** | `01_prd.md:133` defines "Can I buy?" inputs as income + commitments + current spend + days-to-salary + active goals. Checked what actually exists: income is a single loosely-tagged row in `transactions` (usable but fragile), commitments has **no capture mechanism anywhere** — Cold Start (CHAT-07) asks the user for `monthly_commitments` and computes an insight ratio with it, then discards the value without saving it, and no commitments-tracking task existed anywhere in the original backlog despite the PRD listing it as a Tier 1 feature. Active goals depend on GOAL-01 (Stage 4, not built). Building BUY-01→04 in Stage 3 as originally scheduled would ship a verdict engine silently missing 2 of 4 required inputs — the kind of gap that looks like a working feature until a judge or teammate tests the exact scenario it can't actually reason about. |
| **Alternatives** | (A) Build BUY-01 now with commitments/goals hardcoded to zero — rejected: produces a verdict engine that's systematically over-optimistic (always ignoring debt/goals), worse than not shipping it, especially since this is the product's core differentiator and a judge is likely to probe exactly this. (B) Leave BUY-01→04 in Stage 3 as originally scheduled and just accept the gap — rejected, same reasoning as (A). |
| **Impact** | `16_implementation_backlog.md`: Stage 3 is now OCR-only; Stage 4 gains COMMIT-01 (new task — commitments CRUD, seeded from the Cold Start estimate instead of re-asking the user) and BUY-01→04, resequenced so BUY-01 depends on COMMIT-01 + GOAL-01. SIM-01 already depended on BUY-01 in the original backlog, so this also fixes a latent same-stage ordering problem, not just a stage-boundary one. |
| **Related** | `01_prd.md:133`, `16_implementation_backlog.md §Stage 3, §Stage 4`, `05_data_model_erd.md` (commitments table, already deployed), `lib/features/chat/chat_screen.dart` (`_handleColdStartSubmit` — where the commitments value currently gets discarded) |

### DEC-018: Voice Input UX — Mic Button Added to Input Bar

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Date** | 2026-07-12 |
| **Status** | ✅ Closed |
| **Summary** | Add a dedicated microphone button 🎤 to the input bar alongside the existing camera button 📷. Layout (RTL): `↑ │ text │ 🎤 📷`. Voice is the primary input method for Arabic users per PRD — it must be always visible, one-tap, no hidden gestures. |
| **Rationale** | PRD §Tier 1 Coach declares "Zero-friction tracking: Voice, OCR, chat — no manual entry" with voice listed FIRST. Arabic-speaking users overwhelmingly prefer voice over typing. DEC-016 already corrected the platform from iOS-only to cross-platform Android-first with `speech_to_text`. But the UX spec (`03_user_flows_navigation.md`) still showed the old camera-only input bar with no mic. Four options were evaluated: (A) replace camera with mic, (B) add mic as 4th element, (C) long-press on send, (D) toggle between camera/mic. Option B chosen because: voice deserves its own dedicated always-visible button (not hidden behind long-press or toggle), camera is also core to Tier 1 for receipt OCR and cannot be removed, and a 4-element bar is clean enough on modern phones. |
| **Alternatives** | (A) Replace camera with mic — rejected: camera/OCR is also a core Tier 1 feature. (C) Long-press on send ↑ — rejected: not discoverable for non-tech-savvy Arabic users. (D) Toggle between 📷 and 🎤 — rejected: adds extra tap friction, contradicts "zero-friction" principle. |
| **Impact** | `03_user_flows_navigation.md` input bar section updated. CHAT-01 (Build Chat UI) must implement this 4-element layout. CHAT-04 (voice input) now has a defined trigger point. |

### DEC-012: Hala Joins Team as Presentations & Forms Lead

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Date** | 2026-06-29 |
| **Status** | ✅ Closed |
| **Summary** | Hala joins as 4th team member, responsible for AMAD form completion and presentation preparation. |
| **Rationale** | The AMAD form (14-page PDF) requires dedicated effort. Separating presentation/form work from technical design allows specialists to focus. |
| **Impact** | Team now 4 members. `HALA_GUIDE.md` created (21KB) with form field answers mapped to spec files. `assets/AZDAL_AMAD_2026_FORM.pdf` added. All team files updated. |

| **Date** | 2026-06-28 |
| **Status** | ✅ Closed |
| **Summary** | AMAD hackathon preliminary acceptance received. Project advances to build phase. |
| **Rationale** | Registration completed before June 1. Track confirmed: Financial Education. Team of 3 locked. |
| **Impact** | 17-day countdown begins. Specification review phase (3 days) → Finalize (3 days) → Build sprint (~9 days) → Travel → Hackathon. |

### DEC-001: 3-Tier System Architecture

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Date** | 2026-05-21 |
| **Status** | ✅ Closed |
| **Summary** | Adopt 3-tier system: Coach → Smart Lender → Wealth Builder |
| **Rationale** | Each tier feeds the next. Solves sustainability (revenue path) and product cohesion (one journey). Avoids being "just a tracking app." |
| **Alternatives** | (A) Coach-only — rejected: no revenue path, judges said "no solution." (B) Lender-only — rejected: needs SAMA license before MVP, no user base. |
| **Impact** | Defines entire product architecture, monetization strategy, and hackathon MVP scope. |

### DEC-002: Track Selection — Financial Education

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Date** | 2026-05-21 |
| **Status** | ✅ Closed |
| **Summary** | Hackathon track: Financial Education (التعليم المالي) |
| **Rationale** | Core product is educational (AI coach teaches awareness). "Can I buy?" is a teaching moment. Better fit than Generative AI for FinTech — judges value behavioral science + user transformation. Saja pushed based on past finals experience. |
| **Alternatives** | (A) Generative AI for FinTech — rejected: less fit, more competition. |
| **Impact** | Shapes pitch, demo narrative, judge Q&A preparation. |
| **Related** | `docs/business/hackathon-strategy.md` |

### DEC-003: Hybrid Architecture

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Date** | 2026-05-16 |
| **Status** | ✅ Closed |
| **Summary** | LLM understands and routes — SQL calculates, GenUI displays |
| **Rationale** | LLMs hallucinate math. Financial calculations must be deterministic. Multi-agent unanimous validation. |
| **Alternatives** | (A) Full LLM — rejected: hallucination risk in finance is unacceptable. (B) No LLM — rejected: can't handle Arabic NLP without AI. |
| **Impact** | Defines the fundamental architecture constraint for all implementation. |
| **Related** | `07_flutter_architecture.md`, `00_lessons_learned.md §LL-006` |

### DEC-004: Phased Revenue Model

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Date** | 2026-05-21 |
| **Status** | ✅ Closed |
| **Summary** | Phase 1 free (growth), Phase 2 B2B behavioral credit scoring (revenue), Phase 3 lending (margins), Phase 4 investment referrals (commissions) |
| **Rationale** | Avoids needing SAMA license for MVP. Builds user base and behavioral data before monetizing. B2B credit scoring leverages data without lending. |
| **Alternatives** | (A) Premium subscription — rejected: limits growth, wrong for financial education. (B) Lending from day 1 — rejected: needs SAMA license. |
| **Impact** | Defines monetization strategy and license timeline. |
| **Related** | `02_monetization_entitlements.md`, `19_financial_model_unit_economics.md` |

### DEC-005: Hackathon MVP Scope Lock

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Date** | 2026-05-21 |
| **Status** | ✅ Closed |
| **Summary** | Build ONLY Tier 1 Coach. Tier 2 gateway simulated. Tier 3 = vision slides. |
| **Rationale** | Judges penalize scattered solutions. Sharp + working > broad + shallow. Saja's intel: past teams failed because they tried too much. |
| **Alternatives** | (A) Full 3 tiers — rejected: impossible in 4 weeks, diluted impact. |
| **Impact** | Defines build plan and demo strategy. |
| **Related** | `01_prd.md`, `16_implementation_backlog.md` |

### DEC-006: Chat UI as Sole Screen

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Date** | 2026-05-20 |
| **Status** | ✅ Closed |
| **Summary** | Single chat screen. All features are widgets inline. No navigation. No tab bars. |
| **Rationale** | Zero navigation = zero friction. Matches conversational AI form factor. Widget catalog provides feature richness without screen complexity. |
| **Alternatives** | (A) Multi-screen app with chat as one tab — rejected: adds navigation complexity, reduces immersion. |
| **Impact** | Defines all UI architecture and widget catalog design. |
| **Related** | `03_user_flows_navigation.md`, `04_ui_design_system.md` |

### DEC-007: Visual Identity Lock

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Date** | 2026-05-20 |
| **Status** | ✅ Closed |
| **Summary** | Dark mode only. Cairo font. Western numerals. Navy #001F5E + Cyan #32C2FF. |
| **Rationale** | Dark mode = premium fintech feel. Cairo = best Arabic font on mobile. Western numerals = Saudi convention. Navy/Cyan = trust + intelligence. |
| **Alternatives** | (A) Light mode — rejected: fintech apps are dark. (B) Eastern Arabic numerals — rejected: not Saudi convention. |
| **Impact** | Defines all visual design decisions. |
| **Related** | `04_ui_design_system.md`, `docs/design/visual-identity.md` |

### DEC-008: Technology Stack Selection

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Date** | 2026-05-19 |
| **Status** | ✅ Closed |
| **Summary** | Flutter + Gemini Flash + Supabase + Riverpod + Isar local cache |
| **Rationale** | Flutter = single codebase iOS/Android. Gemini = best Arabic LLM. Supabase = free tier + PostgreSQL. Riverpod = compile-safe state. Isar = offline support. |
| **Alternatives** | (A) React Native — rejected: Flutter better Arabic/RTL, superior performance. (B) Firebase — rejected: Supabase has PostgreSQL, better SQL support. (C) GPT-4o — rejected: Gemini superior Arabic NLP. |
| **Impact** | Defines entire development stack. |
| **Related** | `07_flutter_architecture.md` |

### DEC-009: Hybrid Verification Architecture

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Date** | 2026-05-21 |
| **Status** | ✅ Closed |
| **Summary** | Behavioral credit scoring requires: Open Banking ground truth + AI enrichment + Integrity cross-validation |
| **Rationale** | Goodhart's Law: "When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure." Users will game the system if they know data entry = credit access. Ground truth layer prevents gaming. |
| **Alternatives** | (A) Self-reported only — rejected: easily gamed. (B) Bank data only — rejected: loses granularity (bank sees "Carrefour 350", Azdal sees line items). |
| **Impact** | Defines the anti-gaming architecture for B2B credit scoring. |

### DEC-010: Anti-Ghost Protocol Adoption

| Field | Value |

| **Date** | 2026-06-29 |
| **Status** | ✅ Closed |
| **Summary** | No physical deletion. isDeleted=true, deletedAt=timestamp. Follows Flutter Operation Global Contract Rule 4. |
| **Rationale** | Standard across all Flutter projects. Audit trail integrity. Regulatory compliance (PDPL right to correction, not deletion of financial records). |
| **Impact** | Applies to all database tables. |

### DEC-013: Visual Identity Amendment — Logo & Theme

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Date** | 2026-07-12 |
| **Status** | ✅ Closed — supersedes part of DEC-007 |
| **Summary** | Logo changed from Solomon's Seal (🜔) to a shield + upward bar-chart icon. Theme changed from dark-mode-only to light mode. Cairo font, Western numerals, Navy #001F5E + Cyan #32C2FF unchanged from DEC-007. |
| **Rationale** | Both the actual production logo asset and the AMAD demo deck screenshots (Visily mockups) had already diverged from the original spec — shield+chart icon in use, light-theme screens throughout. Resolved via the team's open-questions review (7 items in `FEEDBACK.md`) by updating the spec to match what was actually built rather than rebuilding assets to match a stale spec, given ~4 days to AMAD. |
| **Alternatives** | (A) Revert logo to Solomon's Seal and rebuild mockups in dark mode — rejected: no time, and light mode already reads fine in the existing demo screens. |
| **Impact** | `04_ui_design_system.md` (color palette + layout rule), `docs/design/visual-identity.md` (logo section) updated to match. Any future dark-mode work is a post-hackathon nice-to-have, not MVP scope. |

### DEC-016: Voice/TTS Platform Corrected — iOS-Only → Cross-Platform Android-First

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Date** | 2026-07-12 |
| **Status** | ✅ Closed |
| **Summary** | Voice input and TTS specs corrected from iOS-only Apple frameworks (`Apple Speech`, `AVSpeechSynthesizer`) to cross-platform packages (`speech_to_text`, `flutter_tts`). Azdal is Android-only — the previous specs referenced APIs not accessible on the target platform. |
| **Rationale** | `07_flutter_architecture.md` §1, §2, and §3 all specified Apple Speech and AVSpeechSynthesizer — iOS/macOS on-device frameworks with no Android equivalent. `speech_to_text` wraps Android's native `SpeechRecognizer` (same on-device privacy properties) and provides an identical Dart API if iOS is ever added. `flutter_tts` is the standard cross-platform TTS package. Both are now pre-approved in `00_project_overrides.md` per Global Contract Rule 7. |
| **Alternatives** | (A) Keep Apple-only specs and add conditional platform channels — rejected: unnecessary complexity for a platform the app doesn't target. (B) `record` + cloud STT — rejected: adds latency and network dependency for basic voice input. |
| **Impact** | `07_flutter_architecture.md` §1 table, §2 layer diagram, and §3 stack block updated. `00_project_overrides.md` package exceptions table updated. No code changes — voice input is Stage 3 scope. |
| **Related** | `07_flutter_architecture.md`, `00_project_overrides.md`, `01_prd.md §194` |

### DEC-015: Isar Local Storage Deferred (Post-Hackathon)

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Date** | 2026-07-12 |
| **Status** | ✅ Closed |
| **Summary** | Isar (`^3.1.0`) + `isar_flutter_libs` (`^3.1.0`) removed from `pubspec.yaml` (commented out, not deleted). No production code depends on Isar — zero functional impact. |
| **Rationale** | Isar was re-enabled in pubspec.yaml earlier today (Stage-1 rework). Release builds (`flutter build apk --release`) failed with `AAPT: error: resource android:attr/lStar not found` during `isar_flutter_libs:verifyReleaseResources`. The working fix (patching `namespace` into `~/.pub-cache/hosted/pub.dev/isar_flutter_libs-3.1.0+1/android/build.gradle`) is a local-only hack — not reproducible on any other machine or CI runner. Isar 3.1.0 targets AGP 4.2; Azdal targets AGP 8.8. The AGP compatibility gap is the root cause. |
| **Alternatives** | (A) Fork Isar and port to AGP 8+ — rejected: too large for hackathon timeline, and no code needs it yet. (B) `hive_ce` — considered but not evaluated; Isar's query performance was the original draw. (C) `drift` (SQLite) — also valid; evaluate alongside Isar fork when local caching is actually needed. |
| **Impact** | `path_provider` stays (no AGP issues). When Stage 2 reaches a point that actually needs local caching (offline receipt storage, draft persistence), the task will explicitly evaluate either a maintained AGP 8-compatible Isar fork or an alternative (`drift`, `hive_ce`) — instead of patching the pub cache again. |

### DEC-014: Gemini API Key Shipped Client-Side (Hackathon MVP)
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Date** | 2026-07-12 |
| **Status** | ✅ Closed — accepted risk for hackathon |
| **Summary** | The Gemini API key is compiled into the APK via `--dart-define-from-file=.env`. Any client-side key is extractable by reverse-engineering the APK. This is a known, accepted risk for the hackathon MVP. |
| **Rationale** | Building a backend proxy (Supabase Edge Function) to mediate all Gemini calls is the proper long-term fix, but it adds latency, a new failure domain, and ~4h of work that the hackathon timeline cannot absorb. The key is a free-tier key with low quota — abuse surface is minimal. |
| **Alternatives** | (A) Backend proxy now — rejected: too large for hackathon timeline. (B) Hardcode the key — rejected: `--dart-define-from-file` at least keeps it out of version control. |
| **Impact** | The key will be rotated post-hackathon. A Supabase Edge Function proxy task is added to the post-MVP backlog. This decision is tracked so it doesn't become a silent production gap. |

### DEC-017: Guest-First RLS Resolution — Anonymous Auth

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Date** | 2026-07-12 |
| **Status** | ✅ Closed |
| **Summary** | Resolve the RLS guest-write deadlock by enabling **Supabase Anonymous Sign-In** (`signInAnonymously`). The app calls `supabase.auth.signInAnonymously()` on first launch — Supabase creates a real `auth.users` row with `is_anonymous: true`. This gives every guest user a real UUID-backed JWT, so `auth.uid()` returns a valid value and all 14 existing RLS policies (`auth.uid() = user_id`) work unchanged. No DDL changes, no new columns, no RLS policy modifications needed. |
| **Rationale** | **The Problem:** All 5 tables (transactions, commitments, goals, integrity_scores, purchase_decisions) have FK `user_id REFERENCES auth.users(id)` and RLS policies using `auth.uid() = user_id`. For unauthenticated users, `auth.uid()` returns NULL — blocking ALL writes. **Why not alternatives:** (A) Drop FK + add anon RLS policies with device-generated UUID — breaks referential integrity, requires ALTER on all 5 tables, and creates two code paths (auth vs guest) forever. (B) Edge Function with `service_role` bypass — bypasses RLS entirely, loses per-user data isolation, adds server-side complexity and latency for every write. (C) Add `guest_id` column + modify RLS — same complexity as (A) with worse data model. **Why anonymous auth wins:** Zero DDL changes (no ALTER TABLE risk on deployed data), all FK constraints remain valid, all 14 RLS policies work as-is, clean upgrade path (`linkIdentity()` converts anonymous → email/phone for Tier 2 lending), transparent UX (no form, no registration — just open app and use it). This is the Supabase-recommended pattern for guest-first apps. |
| **Alternatives** | (A) Drop FK to auth.users + anon RLS policies with client-generated UUID — rejected: schema changes on already-deployed tables, breaks referential integrity, creates dual code paths. (B) Edge Function with service_role — rejected: loses per-user isolation, adds server-side complexity, overkill for MVP writes. (C) Shared guest user_id — rejected: no data isolation, all guests share one row namespace. |
| **Impact** | **Database (zero changes):** No DDL, no RLS policy changes needed. All 5 tables and 14 policies work as-is. **Supabase dashboard:** Enable "Anonymous Sign-ins" in Authentication → Providers. **Flutter app:** Add `supabase.auth.signInAnonymously()` call on first launch (when `currentSession == null`). Session persists on-device — guest data survives app restarts. **Security:** Anonymous users get real JWT tokens with `is_anonymous: true` claim. Data is isolated per anonymous user. Accepted risk for MVP: anonymous users can't recover data if they clear app data (no email/password to sign back in). This is acceptable per PRD hackathon exceptions: "No real PII collected — demo data only." **Upgrade path:** When Tier 2 requires real identity (`linkIdentity()` or `signUp()`), existing anonymous data is preserved under the same `user_id`. |
